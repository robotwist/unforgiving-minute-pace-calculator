# Netlify Build Cache Clear Instructions

## Latest Fix: Python Bypass (Commit 4d97485)
**CRITICAL CHANGE**: Completely removed Python detection from Netlify build process:
- ❌ Deleted `runtime.txt` 
- ✅ Added `NETLIFY_SKIP_PYTHON_BUILD = "true"`
- ✅ Direct npm commands: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build`
- ✅ Updated cache ID: `v20250809115000`

## Current Configuration Status
- ✅ **Python completely bypassed**: No more Python version conflicts
- ✅ **Node.js only**: Uses Node 20 for React build
- ✅ **Direct npm commands**: No custom build scripts
- ✅ **Cache invalidation**: New cache ID forces fresh build
- ✅ **Local build verified**: Works perfectly with same commands Netlify will use

## Expected Build Behavior
Netlify should now:
1. ✅ Use only Node.js 20 (no Python detection)
2. ✅ Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
3. ✅ Run `npm run build` 
4. ✅ Deploy from `build/` folder
5. ✅ Generate new file hashes matching local build

## Verification
After deployment, run:
```bash
node deploy.js
```
This will verify the deployed version matches your local build.
