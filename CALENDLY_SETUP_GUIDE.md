# Calendly Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
Your consultation system is now integrated with Calendly. Users who purchase the Personal Coaching plan ($297) can now schedule actual consultations with you.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Your Calendly Account
1. Go to [calendly.com](https://calendly.com) 
2. Sign up for a free account (or upgrade to paid for more features)
3. Set up your availability and preferences

### 2. Create a Consultation Event Type
1. In your Calendly dashboard, click "Create" â†’ "Event Type"
2. Choose "One-on-One" meeting type
3. Configure your consultation:
   - **Event Name**: "Personal Coaching Consultation" 
   - **Duration**: 45 minutes (recommended)
   - **Description**: "Comprehensive assessment of your running goals, current fitness level, and personalized training recommendations"
   - **Location**: Zoom/Google Meet/Phone (your preference)

### 3. Update the Integration Code
Replace the placeholder URL in the code with your actual Calendly link:

**File to edit**: `/src/components/consultation/CalendlyModal.jsx`
**Line 15**: Change `'https://calendly.com/your-calendly-username/consultation'` to your actual Calendly URL

**Example**: If your username is "robwistrand" and event is "coaching-consultation":
```javascript
url: 'https://calendly.com/robwistrand/coaching-consultation',
```

**Line 76**: Also update the fallback link with the same URL
