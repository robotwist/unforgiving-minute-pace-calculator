# 💰 One-Month Pro Plan Strategy

**Goal:** Unpause site immediately, then cancel after one month

---

## ✅ YES - You Can Do This!

**Netlify Pro is month-to-month with no contract:**

1. **Upgrade to Pro** ($19/month)
   - Site unpauses **immediately**
   - Get 1,000 build minutes
   - Keep all Pro benefits

2. **Cancel Anytime**
   - Cancel same day, next day, or at end of month
   - You keep Pro until your billing period ends
   - Then automatically reverts to Free plan

3. **Result:**
   - Site is live now
   - Cost: $19 for one month
   - No long-term commitment

## 💡 Alternative: Check for Add-On Credits

**Before upgrading, check if Netlify offers:**
- One-time credit packs (might be cheaper)
- Build minutes add-ons
- Temporary limit increases

**How to check:**
1. Go to billing page
2. Look for "Add-ons" or "Credit packs"
3. See if there's a cheaper option than full Pro

**If available, might cost less than $19**

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Upgrade to Pro now ($19):**
- ✅ Instant unpause
- ✅ Fix is already in place (ignore command re-enabled)
- ✅ Future builds will be minimal
- ✅ Cancel anytime

**With the fix applied:**
- You'll use ~105-175 build minutes/month (well under 300 free limit)
- So you can safely cancel after one month
- Unlikely to hit limits again

## 💬 Understanding Your Frustration

You're right to feel frustrated - the ignore command being disabled was a temporary troubleshooting step that should have been re-enabled. Unfortunately, Netlify doesn't have a way to retroactively refund build minutes, but:

✅ **Good news:** Fix is already applied
✅ **Good news:** Future usage will be minimal
✅ **Good news:** One month of Pro will cover you through the reset

The $19 is unfortunate, but your site will be live immediately and you won't have this issue again with the fix in place.
