# Deployment Status - Unforgiving Minute GoldenPace Calculator

## 🚀 Latest Deployment: Enhanced GoldenPace Tracking System

### ✅ Successfully Implemented Features:

#### **GoldenPace Tracking & Progression**
- ✅ **Current GoldenPace**: Automatically calculated and stored in user profile
- ✅ **Projected GoldenPace**: 6-week improvement forecast based on training consistency
- ✅ **GoldenPace History**: Complete tracking of all GoldenPace calculations with dates and race data
- ✅ **Training Volume Factor**: Adjustment based on weekly mileage (20-50+ mpw optimal)
- ✅ **Diminishing Returns**: Realistic projections accounting for higher VDOT level difficulty

#### **Enhanced Profile Dashboard**
- ✅ **Visual Progress Chart**: 6-month GoldenPace progression forecast with weekly milestones
- ✅ **Current vs Projected**: Clear display of current GoldenPace and 6-week projection
- ✅ **Mileage-Adjusted Projections**: Calculations based on actual training volume
- ✅ **Training Consistency Tracking**: Integration with training history for accurate forecasting

#### **Mathematical Accuracy**
- ✅ **1 VDOT Point per 6 Weeks**: Industry-standard improvement rate for consistent training
- ✅ **Mileage Factor**: 0.7x to 1.2x multiplier based on training volume (optimal at 40 mpw)
- ✅ **Experience Level Adjustment**: Diminishing returns factor for advanced runners
- ✅ **Progressive Timeline**: 26-week outlook with bi-weekly milestone tracking

### 📊 GoldenPace Calculation Formula:

```
Projected Improvement Rate = Base Rate × Mileage Factor × Diminishing Factor

Where:
- Base Rate = 1 VDOT point / 6 weeks
- Mileage Factor = min(1.2, max(0.7, weekly_mileage / 40))
- Diminishing Factor = max(0.5, 1 - (current_vdot - 40) × 0.01)
```
