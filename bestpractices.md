# Project best practices and standards

This document outlines the best practices and standards to be followed across all aspects of this project, ensuring high quality, security, and maintainability.

## 1. Clean code

*   **1.1 Naming conventions:** Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes (e.g., `calculateTotalPrice()` instead of `calc()`).
*   **1.2 Code formatting:** Adhere to Prettier and ESLint rules configured in .eslintrc.js and .prettierrc
*   **1.3 Modularity:** Break down code into small, focused functions and modules (max 300 lines per component)
*   **1.4 Error handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms, logging errors appropriately with structured logging
*   **1.5 Code comments:** Use comments judiciously to explain complex logic or non-obvious code, especially VDOT calculations

## 2. Systems design

*   **2.1 Architecture principles:** Follow modular React component architecture with separation of concerns (see MODULARIZATION_PLAN.md)
*   **2.2 Design patterns:** Utilize React hooks for state management, service layer for API calls, and custom hooks for business logic
*   **2.3 Scalability:** Design components to scale horizontally with proper code splitting and lazy loading
*   **2.4 Reliability:** Implement fault tolerance with error boundaries, graceful degradation, and retry mechanisms
*   **2.5 Security design:** Embed security considerations from the outset with CSP headers, HTTPS enforcement, and input validation

## 3. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)

*   **3.1 Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML tags for their intended purpose (e.g., `<button>` for buttons).
*   **3.2 Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and usable via keyboard alone.
*   **3.3 Color Contrast:** Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text and graphics.
*   **3.4 ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA attributes to enhance semantics where native HTML isn't sufficient.
*   **3.5 Screen Reader Compatibility:** Test with screen readers to ensure content is accurately announced.

## 4. Security

*   **4.1 OWASP Top 10:** Prioritize addressing vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10. Current implementations include SQL injection protection via Django ORM, XSS protection via React, CSRF protection via Django middleware, and security headers in settings.py
*   **4.2 Secure Coding Practices:** Follow guidelines for preventing common vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, XSS). Input validation implemented in calculator components, output encoding in React components
*   **4.3 API Security:** Implement authentication, authorization, and data validation for all APIs. Django REST framework with token authentication, rate limiting (100/hour anonymous, 1000/hour authenticated), and request validation
*   **4.4 Data Protection:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. TLS 1.3 enforced, database encryption for PII, secure session handling

## 5. SOC 2 compliance

*   **5.1 Data Handling:** Define policies and procedures for handling sensitive data (confidentiality, privacy). See SOC2_COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORK.md for detailed procedures
*   **5.2 Access Control:** Implement strict access control mechanisms based on the principle of least privilege. RBAC implemented with Django permissions, MFA for admin accounts
*   **5.3 Incident Response:** Develop and test incident response plans. See INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN.md for detailed procedures and response team structure
*   **5.4 Change Management:** Establish procedures for managing and documenting changes to the system. Code review required for all changes, staging environment testing, rollback procedures
*   **5.5 Monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring of system activity and security events. Structured logging implemented, security event monitoring, automated threat detection

## 6. Tools and workflow

*   **6.1 CI/CD Integration:** Integrate SAST, DAST, SCA, and accessibility testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline. Accessibility audit script implemented (accessibility-audit.js), security scanning via Railway platform
*   **6.2 Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, including AI-generated code. All changes require peer review, security-sensitive changes require additional security review
*   **6.3 Documentation:** Update this document regularly and ensure all new features and changes are documented. Quarterly review scheduled, incident-based updates required
