## 🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTION

**For immediate restoration:** **Option 1 (Upgrade to Pro)**

**Why:**
- ✅ Instant unpause
- ✅ 1,000 build minutes/month (3x free tier)
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Can cancel after site is unpaused (though you'll keep current month)

**After upgrading:**
1. Site will be live immediately
2. Keep the fix I applied (ignore command re-enabled)
3. Monitor usage going forward

---

## 💡 PREVENT FUTURE PAUSES

**Already done:**
- ✅ Re-enabled ignore command (reduces builds by 50-70%)

**Also do:**
1. Monitor usage weekly: https://app.netlify.com/teams/robify/usage
2. Test builds locally before pushing
3. Batch commits when possible
4. Consider staying on Pro plan if usage stays high
